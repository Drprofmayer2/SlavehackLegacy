Hey there Gryphon, I love the idea. I'm very excited about helping
out with this massive project. I don't want to just start making
random commits (besides this one) but I wanted you to be able to
contact me via email so that maybe we can get the project back in
motion even while you're at school.

Just let me know what you're working on and the direction you're
going and I'll see if I can put some work in while you're away.
