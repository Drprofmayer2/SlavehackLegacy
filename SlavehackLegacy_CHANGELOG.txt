All changes below are for the pre-game site only.
============================================
+ Added a simple hover effect to the menu, links and footer.
- Removed some needless/redundant CSS formatting codes throughout.
+ Added a "page_parts.php" file that allows us to change one file versus changing each page at a time. This file currently includes the menu and footer codes in separate functions.
TODO: Will add each page's content to the "page_parts.php" file so a one-file-update can be achieved.
- Removed the difficult background image.
+ Added an easy to manage background that has maintains site relevance.
+ Forced the footer information to the bottom of the screen. Now follows scroll motion.
+ Added a bottom margin to the wrapper to compensate for the footer's area. The bad look only appeared on "long" pages such as "register.php".
TODO: Changed margins in the wrapper to fix "bunching" on form pages. Should not affect normal content pages.
TODO: Added a ticking clock versus the static clock that only updated on page refreshes.
TODO: Changed the look of form components for better site immersion.
